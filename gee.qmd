## Animal behaviour

Studies of animal behaviour are used to shed light on aspects of human functioning in many areas of psychology. However, this course will explore animal behaviour as a fascinating topic in its own right, with any implications for human psychology emerging as bonuses rather than being our primary goal. We will explore different approaches and traditions in the study of animal behaviour, and there will be particular emphasis on recent developments in the application of psychology in animal husbandry and welfare.

Format: This option will be taught in a series of five lectures (which will include a number of videos of animal behaviour), three delivered by Phil Gee, two by Joanna Newbolt. Joanna is a lecturer in animal behaviour and welfare in the School of Biological Sciences & Marine Sciences. If timetables allow, there may be an optional visit to a local zoo and/or aquarium to see how psychological principles are used to improve animal welfare. You will need to read around the subject in order to do well.
