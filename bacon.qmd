## Criminals in the making

The law has long recognised the link between psychology and crime, as embodied in the legal principle of mens rea or "guilty mind" - meaning an individual cannot be considered guilty of a crime unless they have carried out the act wilfully and intentionally. But why do some people commit crime, while others do not? Are criminals born or made?

This option will explore some of the key determinants of delinquent and criminal behaviour from a bio-psycho-social perspective. It will take an individual differences approach to understanding the influence of personality dispositions and social and familial factors as well as considering the evidence for a biological basis to criminal behaviour.

Please note that if you are doing a joint honours degree with Criminology, you may have already covered some of the material in this option. If this is an issue for you, please consider an alternative.

This option will be taught in lecture format, however student participation is highly encouraged in discussing material presented in the sessions. There is no single set textbook and readings from specific research articles will be recommended.
