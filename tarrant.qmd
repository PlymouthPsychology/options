## Group membership, social identity and health: Is there such a thing as a “social cure”?

The social identity approach to health (SIAH) is an approach to health which focuses on the important role of social group memberships in shaping individuals' health outcomes and associated cognitions and behaviours. Central to the approach is the prediction that the impact of group membership on health is fundamentally shaped by the psychological meaning of that membership to the group members. This core prediction has been supported in a large number of studies, using diverse methodologies, and in healthy and unhealthy populations. In this option we review key studies within the SIAH and consider its relevance for healthcare practice by addressing the question: Does the SIAH realistically constitute the basis of a "social cure"?

Important note: The sessions on this option require active student participation, including group work and student-led summaries of discussions. You should only sign up for the option if you are willing to engage in this way. Full attendance at timetabled sessions is expected.

### Unsure whether to sign up for this option?

The following article discusses the empirical underpinnings of the SIAH and provides a brief, but excellent, introduction to the topic. It is strongly recommended that students read this article before deciding whether to take this option.
