## Body image

Body image represents a person's subjective view of their body; their feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and beliefs about their body that impact how they behave toward it (Cash, 2004). The lectures in this module will explore selected topics on body image, including its links with health (for example psychopathology, medical conditions, and health behaviours). In particular, there will be a focus on body shame, an emotion related to self-perceived social status. The sessions will go on to consider the role of self-compassion in mitigating the effects of body image and body shame (so-called “body compassion”) on health outcomes, including approaches to improving this.
