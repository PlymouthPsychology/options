title: "Assessment Types"
---

You will encounter several different types of assessment. These include:

*	exams
*	written coursework
*	presentations
*	online tests
*	Psylab
* research participation

Each of these types of assessment is suited to assessing skills and knowledge in different ways. You will probably find that you like some forms of assessment better than others, and we maintain a balance of different assessment types in each year of study to make sure that all students have an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and skills fairly.
