## Social norms

Social norms are the grammar of society: they structure our social interactions, guide our behaviour, and facilitate coordination and cooperation. How do children develop an understanding of norms and become normative beings? How does this understanding develop across cultures? Do other animals have social norms? These are some of the questions that we will explore in this option by drawing on findings from developmental, comparative, and cross-cultural psychology and, occasionally, from related fields such as anthropology and biology. The option will consist of a mixture of lectures and in-class activities.
