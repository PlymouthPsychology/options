title: "Deadlines"
---

Each assessment has a deadline, specified in the "Assessment" section of the programme DLE page:

<https://dle.plymouth.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=38727>

In the unlikely event of revisions to deadlines, these will be sent by email and the list of deadlines will be updated.

Deadlines are strict â€“ late submission of work without valid extenuating circumstances will incur a penalty.
