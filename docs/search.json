    "text": "Memory, amnesia, and awareness\nCan our memories influence our behaviour, but outside of our awareness? Intuitively, we feel like they can, but demonstrating this in the laboratory has proven to be a controversial topic. There is now a fascinating array of research relating to unconscious, or implicit, memory. We will explore this research by examining major theories of unconscious memory the main ways of demonstrating that memories can be unconscious. We will also look at a new line of evidence that suggests that amnesia can be demonstrated in all individuals, not only those with clinical amnesia. This is the new phenomenon of Everyday Amnesia. We’ve all had the experience of completely forgetting an experience or an event. A deeper understanding of these issues has profound consequences for understanding memory impairments in amnesia and healthy ageing, and also for understanding the influences that shape our behaviour in the world.\nFormat: In each lecture we will use interactive polling (with mentimeter.com) to have regular informal quizzes. This option will be taught with five lectures, plus a revision lecture. Recommended readings will be given in each lecture.\n\nReadings\nSquire, L. R., & Dede, A. J. (2015).

We will explore social inference, heuristics, attitudes, stereotypes, discrimination and prejudice with a particular view to how media affects these things. Lecture 2 will then move beyond social cognition, looking at the relationship between body and brain, delving into newer theories of embodied cognition. Lecture 3 will explore the role of movement in our everyday lives and how the way in which we move with those around us affects our personal relationships, group dynamics and may even lead to a reduction in prejudice or an increase in conformity to commit aggressive acts. Lecture 4 will detail the research around autism and theory of mind (or perspective taking), with a view to exploring if and how these findings generalise to hon human agents, and what findings in this area might mean for traditional accounts of autism. Lecture 5 will finally focus on Games and social cognition, this session will be split into two smaller lectures, one on digital games and one on analog or board games. The first will explore a growing field of work showing the overlap between autism and modern table top gaming, exploring how this area dispels some common autism myths and how games and gamification might be a naturalistic alternative to traditional autism interventions.

This has prompted some authors to argue that this chemical is the “Kim Kardashian of neurotransmitters” and exerts a disproportionate influence on science and technology. The current trend to equate dopamine with “pleasure” is certainly false and leads to a misunderstanding of this neurotransmitter’s role in shaping human behaviour. In fact, dopamine is essential for human life and is involved, or capable of influencing, nearly all aspects of human behaviour. This unit will focus on understanding the (possibly) essential role of dopamine in facilitating cognitive control and motivation. We will explore the role dopamine has on these processes through looking at: i) neurological disorders that deplete dopamine levels (e.g., Parkinson’s disease ii) pharmacological manipulations that try and change dopamine levels (e,g., Ritalin) and iii) behavioural interventions that affect dopamine levels (e.g., financial incentives).\n\nReadings\nCools, R., & Robbins, T.

How children develop language has been debated for thousands of years, starting in ancient Mesopotamian and Greek philosophers. Over the past 60 years, we have had the empirical and theoretical tools to address this fundamental issue, and distinguish how nature and nurture interact in this learning process. In these lectures, we will cover the main findings of the past decades, focusing on the early years (0 to 2 years). We will also explore the most recent areas of research in the field: how children retrieve words from the continuous speech stream, how they learn about the elementary speech sounds, how bilingualism shapes early speech perception, how language is implemented in the developing brain.\nFormat: This option will be taught in five lectures.\n\nReadings\nBarrett, M.

The use of psychometrics and behaviour therapy in long stay institutions formed some of the early work of psychologists within the health service and contributed to the development of the profession. In the twenty first century, working as a clinical psychologist with people with intellectual disabilities has a greater focus on empowerment, equality and human rights. It is a varied, fascinating and uplifting area of clinical practice. This module will offer an overview of the role of clinical psychology within services for people with intellectual disabilities. We will cover the history of terminology and classification and explore current definitions of the term ‘intellectual disabilities’, including associated genetic conditions, behavioural phenotypes and a social constructionist perspective. We will examine the history of clinical interventions with people with intellectual disabilities and explore their development to contemporary clinical practice. We will also explore the impact of the wider social context and of hearing the voices of people with intellectual disabilities.\n\nReadings\nWebb, J.

The brain is made up of about 100 billion neurons, each with an average of 7000 connections with other neurons; which means that the average human brain has about 700 trillion connections. Each one of these connections communicates using specific chemicals called neurotransmitters. There are more than 100 different types of neurotransmitter in the human brain, most of which act upon several different types of receptor, producing either inhibitory or excitatory effects. This amazing organ is the most complex machine in the known universe. However, while this complexity provides great and diverse possibilities for function, it brings an equal opportunity for dysfunction, resulting in a diverse array of neurological disorders.\nIn this course, we will discuss a variety of different neurological disorders and explore the details of epidemiology, symptoms and diagnosis. We will link these aspects to the biological basis of each disorder and then to the various drugs that can be used in their treatment. Finally, we will explore the outcomes of these treatments and discuss where current research might lead to future treatments. By the end of this course you should have an understanding of the brain regions involved in various neurological disorders, the physiological and pharmacological changes that underlie the symptoms of those disorders and how the drugs used for treatment might improve the quality of life in patients."

We argue that feelings are not only direct translations of external stimulations, but also depend on interoception and high-level cognitive processing. Indeed, feeling is closely related to the concept of the self and consciousness, therefore, is likely to be reflected by our thought patterns that represent the information processed by human cognition.\nBy exploring the interplay of emotion, thought and behaviour, we examine how ongoing thought patterns can be utilized for examining emotional experiences and how this method can be adopted for clinical diagnosis of psychopathologies.\nThis option will have five 2-hours interactive classes consisting of lectures and small class activities for group discussions and/or self-reflections.

But what happens when we begin to question the traditional disease model, and to look beyond conventional approaches to mental health? This option will give you good foundational knowledge of clinical psychology while bringing in some fresh perspectives.\nLecture 1 – Principles of clinical psychology\nIn Lecture 1 we will create a solid foundation for the rest of the option by exploring key concepts in clinical psychology. What does it mean to be a reflective scientist-practitioner? What place do personal values have in professional practice?\nLecture 2 – Counselling theory and practical skills\nIn Lecture 2 we look at counselling (non-directional psychotherapy) in detail. Where did this therapy come from, and what skills does a counsellor or non-directive psychotherapist need? You will be given a choice of different activities designed to help you understand and experience these clinical skills.\nLecture 3 – CBT theory, skills, and applications\nIn Lecture 3 we look at Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) in detail. How did CBT come about, and what is it, exactly? You will have the opportunity to learn about and practice cognitive-behavioural techniques including CBT formulation, thought-challenging exercises, and behavioural experimentation. We will also explore how CBT can be used and applied beyond traditional therapeutic settings.\nLecture 4 – Critical psychology\nFrom here on, things become a little different. Using a guided problem-based approach, we will explore the concepts of critical psychology and critical theory. What does social justice have to do with clinical psychology? What happens when we look at clinical psychology and psychotherapy through this critical lens?\nLecture 5 – Spirituality and psychotherapy\nWe are hearing more and more about the ‘spiritual dimension’ of our lives—about mind, body, and spirit—and even the idea of a biopsychosocialspiritual approach to healthcare. But what do we really mean when we talk about spirituality in this context? Is it essential to consider the spiritual for a truly holistic practice, or is this something we shouldn’t even be discussing as scientist-practitioners? Lecture 5 explores recent shifts towards integrating spirituality into psychotherapy. What might this mean, not only for clinical psychology, but for our broader worldview?"

The need to understand and predict the behaviour of others is thought to account for the disproportionately large brain size of humans. Our social brains have given us the ability to navigate this most complex and unpredictable aspect of our environment with remarkable ease.\nOur social brains are able to uncover the hidden internal world of other people to reveal the goals, intentions, emotions, and beliefs that drive their behaviour, and predict how they will behave and respond in the future. We must think about what other people are thinking, and our perceptual system is especially attuned to the sight, sound, and touch of other people. Difficulties in thinking about and perceiving other people may be why those with schizophrenia and autism find social interactions so challenging.\nOur social brains also crave the company and acceptance of others. The pain of loneliness is analogous to that of physical pain, and social anxiety reflects the fear of social rejection. Ultimately, social exclusion and conflict can decrease our lifespan and is a common risk for numerous mental health conditions.\nThis option will look at the evolution of the social brain, the importance of social interactions on our physical and mental health, the cognitive and neural mechanisms that enable us to understand and perceive other people, and how difficulties in social cognition may characterise conditions such as autism and schizophrenia.\nLecture 1: The Evolution of the Social Brain.\nLecture 2: Social Perception: Seeing, Hearing, Touching other people.\nLecture 3: Mentalising: Thinking about Other People.\nLecture 4: The Social Brian and Mental Health.\nLecture 5: Social Cognition in Autism and Schizophrenia.\nLecture 6: Revision"

    "text": "Harnessing the human imagination\nPeople differ in their capacity to visualise, from those who can create vivid and detailed images in their mind, to those who cannot see anything at all (also known as “aphantasia”). Often referred to as “seeing” through the “mind’s eye”, “hearing” through the “mind’s ear”, and so on, the capacity to generate mental imagery is thought to help humans survive by remembering the past and anticipating the future. With modern research methods, psychological scientists are beginning to understand the nature and functions of our imagination, although much remains unknown. By the end of this module, you will have gained insight into questions like a) What does the imagination have to do with our feelings, motivations, and behaviours; b) How do distortions in the imagination contribute to mental health conditions; & c) Can we harness the imagination to motivates us to regulate our emotional wellbeing and make healthier choices?\n\nLearning format\nThis course will be taught in an interactive style using a combination of lectures, individual and group activities.\n\n\nKey readings\n· Pearson, J., Naselaris, T., Holmes, E.

    "text": "The misdirected mind\nMagic is an artform that relies on deception and misdirection to create experiences that violate our understanding of the world. For example, magicians can make objects disappear in a puff of smoke or read your mind. Humans have always been captivated by magical experiences, and the psychological mechanisms that underpin these experiences provide important insights into the nature of cognition. In this option we will examine why our mind can be deceived into experiencing things that we know to be impossible. We will start by examining why we enjoy being fooled and examine how the scientific study of magic can help us understand the human mind. Magicians use misdirection to create their magical illusions, but these principles are applied to wide aspects of our lives (e.g. politics, cyber deception). We will examine how and why misdirection works and challenge the amount we truly perceive and look at a range of perceptual illusions. Magicians create magical illusion that we know to be false, but a large proportion of the population mistake these magical phenomena as reality. Why do people believe in magic, and what role does magical thinking (e.g., paranormal beliefs, superstitions) play in our everyday cognition? Mentalism is a form of magic that involves manipulating psychological processes rather than the physical world and magicians have developed powerful misdirection techniques that manipulate our thoughts. We will examine the science behind this form of mind control (i.e. forcing) and challenge the idea that we are in control over the things we do and think. In the final part we will examine hypnosis and look at the extent to which hypnotic suggestions can influence people’s thoughts and behaviours.\nBy the end of this option, you will have gained a new perspective on our susceptibility to misdirection, and you may even have learnt to perform a trick or two.\nLearning objective 1. Challenge intuitions about our cognitive abilities 2. Gain insights into our susceptibility towards misdirection and misinformation 3. Apply cognitive psychology to the real world 4.

There will also be a voluntary session in which you will experience what hypnosis feels like.\n\nLecture 1\nIntroduction to the art of magic - What is magic?

    "section": "How do people cause planes to crash and ferries to sink? The role of human factors in everyday life",
    "text": "How do people cause planes to crash and ferries to sink? The role of human factors in everyday life\nOn the 27th March 1977, two Boeing 747 jumbo jets collided on the runway of Los Rodeos Airport on Tenerife. The total number of fatalities was 583, and it remains the deadliest accident in aviation history. Ten years later, on 6th March 1987, 1875 miles away, outside the port of Zeebrugge in Belgium, a passenger ferry bound for Dover capsized, leading to 193 people losing their lives. There were no mechanical issues with either airplane, nor the ferry. Instead, human factors, such as verbal communication, social hierarchies, the effects of shift work, and corporate pressures on staff, led to these tragedies.\nIn this option, we’ll delve into this area of applied psychology, known as human factors. You don’t need to be a captain of a ship or a jet plane to be influenced by human factors. Every day, we interact with artificial environments, from driving cars and logging onto computers to operating complex machinery. Some individuals even interact with and operate highly advanced technologies, such as operating nuclear power plants. Human Factors explores how humans interact with these technological environments, how technology influences performance, comfort, and health, and how our understanding of human capabilities and limitations, as outlined in psychology, should be used to design safer and more effective technology, work, and work systems.\nWe’ll cover topics like the effects of shift work on the workforce, warning systems, and the concept of human error, including the psychological processes that result in errors. Case studies of major incidents such as airplane crashes and nuclear disasters will illustrate the course. This course is particularly suitable for students interested in careers in applied areas of psychology, such as occupational or human factors/ergonomics, as well as those who want to apply psychological knowledge to real-world problems and issues."

More information on this is provided in the section describing how degrees are awarded.\nAs a guide, a pass mark is anything above 40%. Marks from 40% to 49% correspond to a third class degree, marks from 50% to 59% correspond to a 2:2, and marks from 60% to 69% correspond to a 2:1. Marks of 70% or higher are equivalent to a first class standard of work.\nThe mark you receive will usually be a percentage score. Where work is marked using categorical grades (e.g. A-, C+) these will be converted into percentages using a standard table, provided here.\n\n\n\nGrade\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nA+\n100\n\n\nA\n88\n\n\nA-\n77\n\n\nB+\n68\n\n\nB\n65\n\n\nB-\n62\n\n\nC+\n58\n\n\nC\n55\n\n\nC-\n52\n\n\nD+\n48\n\n\nD\n45\n\n\nD-\n42\n\n\nF+\n38\n\n\nF\n25\n\n\nF-\n15\n\n\nN\n0\n\n\n\nAn assignment or exam might consist of more than one piece of work marked in this way, in which case your mark will be an aggregate of the separate grades in the proportions specified in the module outline.\nNote that the first class grades (A+, A, A-) are spaced further apart on the percentage scale than grades in the lower classes. This is designed to recognise the achievements of students who submit at least some first class work, by effectively giving first class marks more weighting when marks are aggregated together.\n\nReceiving your mark\nIf you are unhappy with your mark, you cannot ask for it to be re-marked simply because you question the marker’s academic judgement. If a clerical error (such as entering an incorrect grade) has been made then the mark can be corrected provided we are made aware of the problem.\nIf you have a question about a grade you have been awarded, in the first instance contact the module leader or the person who set the work to discuss it (e.g. during their office hours). It would be helpful to bring a copy of the work and feedback you have received, and to highlight any areas of concern. In most cases the module leader will be able to explain the mark awarded or, where an error has occurred, correct the mark immediately.\nYou should always keep a copy of the coursework which you have submitted. Once you have had your work returned you should also keep the returned work and the feedback sheet with the grade awarded. Evidence of the original mark awarded to you is important if the Faculty needs to correct or add missing marks to your overall mark profile.\nYou should note that all marks you receive on returned coursework are provisional until agreed by the Subject Assessment Panel in June. Although it is unlikely, it is possible for the marks which you have received for a piece of work to be changed by this panel. Your end of year transcript will show your final agreed marks for each module which you have taken."

What are its main causes?\nConsequences of first impressions – How can our impressions influence our dating preferences, political elections and even court sentencing decisions?\nFirst impressions from other modalities – How do we evaluate the people we meet based on their voice, body or their name?\nSources of variability in first impressions – How are men and women evaluated along social dimensions?

It has been a similarly important tool for psychologists, and drawings have been used to understand topics as diverse as child development and clinical impairment. It is, however, rarely discussed as a subject in its own right. In this option we will explore the many facets of drawing and develop our own critical ideas about how it might be better used in psychology. The topics covered in lectures will include the relationship between drawing and art, and why most people have difficulty drawing what is in front of them. We will also discuss the striking ways in which drawings can reveal the difficulties people experience after neurological damage, as well as the savant artistic abilities possessed by some people with autism. Tying all of these insights together will be a journey through the methods that psychologists have developed to study drawing in a more scientific way, and demonstrations of the unexpected commonalities that we all share in our drawing production, regardless of artistic aptitude. Across all of these insights, I will show that, in an age of increasingly sophisticated and expensive technology, it is still possible to conduct careful and insightful scientific work with pencil and paper.

Central to the approach is the prediction that the impact of group membership on health is fundamentally shaped by the psychological meaning of that membership to the group members. This core prediction has been supported in a large number of studies, using diverse methodologies, and in healthy and unhealthy populations. In this option we review key studies within the SIAH and consider its relevance for healthcare practice by addressing the question: Does the SIAH realistically constitute the basis of a “social cure”?\nImportant note: The sessions on this option require active student participation, including group work and student-led summaries of discussions.

This option will focus on the natural environment specifically, examining a) theories, b) empirical research and evidence, and c) practical application and real-life examples of how nature impacts us; and how, through our behaviour, we impact the natural world. This option will answer the following questions:\n\nWhat is Environmental Psychology?\nWhat are the benefits of spending time in nature to our mental health and wellbeing and cognitive performance?\nWhat is our emotional, cognitive and behavioural relationship with the natural world, and why is this important?\nWhat is “pro-environmental behaviour”? Why is it important, and why do some people behave pro-environmentally and others not?\nWhat drives our behaviour? How and when do social norms play a pivotal role?\n\n\nFormat\nThis option will be taught in 5 interactive classes (2 hrs. each), which combine short lectures with interactive elements such as discussions, group activities, and self-reflections. Each lecture will be accompanied with suggested further reading (journal articles, watching videos, listening to podcasts) to do before and/or after the timetabled session.\n\n\nGeneral reading\nFurther, specific readings will be recommended in each class\nPahl, P., & Wyles, K.
