    "text": "Social cognition in action\nIn this option we will explore some areas of social cognition in action in the real world. rather than focus on one specific area, we will explore a range of research areas within and beyond social cognition in action.\nThe first lecture will lay the ground work with the basic theories and foundations of social cognition. We will explore social inference, heuristics, attitudes, stereotypes, discrimination and prejudice with a particular view to how media affects these things. Lecture 2 will then move beyond social cognition, looking at the relationship between body and brain, delving into newer theories of embodied cognition. Lecture 3 will explore the role of movement in our everyday lives and how the way in which we move with those around us affects our personal relationships, group dynamics and may even lead to a reduction in prejudice or an increase in conformity to commit aggressive acts. Lecture 4 will detail the research around autism and theory of mind (or perspective taking), with a view to exploring if and how these findings generalise to hon human agents, and what findings in this area might mean for traditional accounts of autism. Lecture 5 will finally focus on Games and social cognition, this session will be split into two smaller lectures, one on digital games and one on analog or board games. The first will explore a growing field of work showing the overlap between autism and modern table top gaming, exploring how this area dispels some common autism myths and how games and gamification might be a naturalistic alternative to traditional autism interventions. The second will explore the research on the social consequences of video games, exploring well publicised accounts of whether violent and sexist portrayals in video games affects those who play as well as research suggesting that games may have more pro-social uses.\n\nLecture 1 - Social cognition in action\nKey background and concepts\n\n\nLecture 2 - Beyond social cognition\nEmbodied and enclothed cognition\n\n\nLecture 3 - Synchrony and social cognition\nHow moving together binds us together\n\n\nLecture 4 - Seeing more than human\nAutism, theory of mind and anthropomorphism\n\n\nLecture 5 – Games and social cognition\n5.1 - Board Games as a tool to study social cognition in autism\n5.2 - Video games & Social cognition, the good, the bad and the unexpected\n\n\nReadings\nKey open access research papers specific to each topic will be recommended in each lecture, but below are some relevant books if you want to get a head start.\nFiske, S.

    "text": "Clinical psychology with people with intellectual disabilities\nClinical psychology could be said to owe a debt to people with intellectual disabilities (also termed learning disabilities in the UK). The use of psychometrics and behaviour therapy in long stay institutions formed some of the early work of psychologists within the health service and contributed to the development of the profession. In the twenty first century, working as a clinical psychologist with people with intellectual disabilities has a greater focus on empowerment, equality and human rights. It is a varied, fascinating and uplifting area of clinical practice. This module will offer an overview of the role of clinical psychology within services for people with intellectual disabilities. We will cover the history of terminology and classification and explore current definitions of the term ‘intellectual disabilities’, including associated genetic conditions, behavioural phenotypes and a social constructionist perspective. We will examine the history of clinical interventions with people with intellectual disabilities and explore their development to contemporary clinical practice. We will also explore the impact of the wider social context and of hearing the voices of people with intellectual disabilities.\n\nReadings\nWebb, J.

    "text": "The misdirected mind\nMagic is an artform that relies on deception and misdirection to create experiences that violate our understanding of the world. For example, magicians can make objects disappear in a puff of smoke or read your mind. Humans have always been captivated by magical experiences, and the psychological mechanisms that underpin these experiences provide important insights into the nature of cognition. In this option we will examine why our mind can be deceived into experiencing things that we know to be impossible. We will start by examining why we enjoy being fooled and examine how the scientific study of magic can help us understand the human mind. Magicians use misdirection to create their magical illusions, but these principles are applied to wide aspects of our lives (e.g. politics, cyber deception). We will examine how and why misdirection works and challenge the amount we truly perceive and look at a range of perceptual illusions. Magicians create magical illusion that we know to be false, but a large proportion of the population mistake these magical phenomena as reality. Why do people believe in magic, and what role does magical thinking (e.g., paranormal beliefs, superstitions) play in our everyday cognition? Mentalism is a form of magic that involves manipulating psychological processes rather than the physical world and magicians have developed powerful misdirection techniques that manipulate our thoughts. We will examine the science behind this form of mind control (i.e. forcing) and challenge the idea that we are in control over the things we do and think. In the final part we will examine hypnosis and look at the extent to which hypnotic suggestions can influence people’s thoughts and behaviours.\nBy the end of this option, you will have gained a new perspective on our susceptibility to misdirection, and you may even have learnt to perform a trick or two.\nLearning objective 1. Challenge intuitions about our cognitive abilities 2. Gain insights into our susceptibility towards misdirection and misinformation 3. Apply cognitive psychology to the real world 4.

For instance, we often face questions such as ‘Is the suspect guilty?’ or ‘Does the bag contain a dangerous object?’ These situations ask us to distinguish between truth or signal and falsehood or noise, even when we have only partial or ambiguous information. Signal detection theory provides a framework for measuring how well we can differentiate signal from noise, termed sensitivity, independently of our tendency to respond a certain way, referred to as bias. It also offers insights for enhancing the success of our decisions in various contexts.\nThese lectures will introduce the basic concepts of detection theory and explore its applications in areas like placebo effects, eyewitness testimony, forensic judgements, and systemic discrimination. The lectures will include guided hands-on exercises, and discussions of current literature.",

Little do they suspect that for this milestone to occur, the child must have accumulated an enormous amount of information about her maternal language. How children develop language has been debated for thousands of years, starting in ancient Mesopotamian and Greek philosophers. Over the past 60 years, we have had the empirical and theoretical tools to address this fundamental issue, and distinguish how nature and nurture interact in this learning process. In these lectures, we will cover the main findings of the past decades, focusing on the early years (0 to 2 years). We will also explore the most recent areas of research in the field: how children retrieve words from the continuous speech stream, how they learn about the elementary speech sounds, how bilingualism shapes early speech perception, how language is implemented in the developing brain.\nFormat: This option will be taught in five lectures.\n\nReadings\nBarrett, M.

This has prompted some authors to argue that this chemical is the “Kim Kardashian of neurotransmitters” and exerts a disproportionate influence on science and technology. The current trend to equate dopamine with “pleasure” is certainly false and leads to a misunderstanding of this neurotransmitter’s role in shaping human behaviour. In fact, dopamine is essential for human life and is involved, or capable of influencing, nearly all aspects of human behaviour. This unit will focus on understanding the (possibly) essential role of dopamine in facilitating cognitive control and motivation. We will explore the role dopamine has on these processes through looking at: i) neurological disorders that deplete dopamine levels (e.g., Parkinson’s disease ii) pharmacological manipulations that try and change dopamine levels (e,g., Ritalin) and iii) behavioural interventions that affect dopamine levels (e.g., financial incentives).\n\nReadings\nCools, R., & Robbins, T.

We argue that feelings are not only direct translations of external stimulations, but also depend on interoception and high-level cognitive processing. Indeed, feeling is closely related to the concept of the self and consciousness, therefore, is likely to be reflected by our thought patterns that represent the information processed by human cognition.\nBy exploring the interplay of emotion, thought and behaviour, we examine how ongoing thought patterns can be utilized for examining emotional experiences and how this method can be adopted for clinical diagnosis of psychopathologies.\nThis option will have five 2-hours interactive classes consisting of lectures and small class activities for group discussions and/or self-reflections.

We will explore this research by examining major theories of unconscious memory the main ways of demonstrating that memories can be unconscious. We will also look at a new line of evidence that suggests that amnesia can be demonstrated in all individuals, not only those with clinical amnesia. This is the new phenomenon of Everyday Amnesia. We’ve all had the experience of completely forgetting an experience or an event. A deeper understanding of these issues has profound consequences for understanding memory impairments in amnesia and healthy ageing, and also for understanding the influences that shape our behaviour in the world.\nFormat: In each lecture we will use interactive polling (with mentimeter.com) to have regular informal quizzes.

This means that students can choose different options, even though they may be registered for the same modules.\nEach module consists of two blocks of options, which run one after the other. Block A comes first, and contains options that are assessed by coursework. This is followed by Block B, which contains options that are assessed by exam. Students must choose one option from each of Block A and Block B for each module that they are registered on. This means that the total number of options chosen across Stage 4 will be:\nBSc Psychology and MPsych: Eight options (two in each of four modules)\nCombined honours: Four options (two in each of two modules)\nBlocks run in sequence, so students attend one option at a time. Each block consists of three weeks of scheduled sessions.

    "text": "Each piece of summative work will receive a mark that will count towards your overall mark for that module. In turn, your module marks will determine your degree classification. More information on this is provided in the section describing how degrees are awarded.\nAs a guide, a pass mark is anything above 40%. Marks from 40% to 49% correspond to a third class degree, marks from 50% to 59% correspond to a 2:2, and marks from 60% to 69% correspond to a 2:1. Marks of 70% or higher are equivalent to a first class standard of work.\nThe mark you receive will usually be a percentage score. Where work is marked using categorical grades (e.g. A-, C+) these will be converted into percentages using a standard table, provided here.\n\n\n\nGrade\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nA+\n100\n\n\nA\n88\n\n\nA-\n77\n\n\nB+\n68\n\n\nB\n65\n\n\nB-\n62\n\n\nC+\n58\n\n\nC\n55\n\n\nC-\n52\n\n\nD+\n48\n\n\nD\n45\n\n\nD-\n42\n\n\nF+\n38\n\n\nF\n25\n\n\nF-\n15\n\n\nN\n0\n\n\n\nAn assignment or exam might consist of more than one piece of work marked in this way, in which case your mark will be an aggregate of the separate grades in the proportions specified in the module outline.\nNote that the first class grades (A+, A, A-) are spaced further apart on the percentage scale than grades in the lower classes. This is designed to recognise the achievements of students who submit at least some first class work, by effectively giving first class marks more weighting when marks are aggregated together.\n\nReceiving your mark\nIf you are unhappy with your mark, you cannot ask for it to be re-marked simply because you question the marker’s academic judgement. If a clerical error (such as entering an incorrect grade) has been made then the mark can be corrected provided we are made aware of the problem.\nIf you have a question about a grade you have been awarded, in the first instance contact the module leader or the person who set the work to discuss it (e.g. during their office hours). It would be helpful to bring a copy of the work and feedback you have received, and to highlight any areas of concern. In most cases the module leader will be able to explain the mark awarded or, where an error has occurred, correct the mark immediately.\nYou should always keep a copy of the coursework which you have submitted. Once you have had your work returned you should also keep the returned work and the feedback sheet with the grade awarded. Evidence of the original mark awarded to you is important if the Faculty needs to correct or add missing marks to your overall mark profile.\nYou should note that all marks you receive on returned coursework are provisional until agreed by the Subject Assessment Panel in June. Although it is unlikely, it is possible for the marks which you have received for a piece of work to be changed by this panel. Your end of year transcript will show your final agreed marks for each module which you have taken."

We will look at the causes of cravings, and the role that they play in leading to use of addictive substances, consumption of foods, or engagement in other activities. By understanding the nature of craving, and the cognitive processes that are involved in craving, we will try to work out why some people give in to cravings, and why some people can abstain. We will consider the implications that this has for treating addiction and appetitive disorders, and for motivating beneficial behaviours.\nFormat: This option will be taught with five seminars that combine lecturing and small group work during the session and in-between sessions.\n\nReading\nKavanagh, D., Andrade, J., & May, J.

    "text": "Attractiveness: Why, what and how?\nFor thousands of years, the concepts of beauty and attractiveness have captivated human thought. These themes have been central to discussions since the earliest civilizations, evident in the writings of ancient philosophers and thinkers and continuing into the works of contemporary scholars and intellectuals. Charles Darwin, through his theory of sexual selection, offered a significant scientific explanation and rationale for the existence and importance of beauty and attractiveness. His theory helped to understand these concepts not just as cultural or aesthetic preferences, but as key elements in the evolutionary process of species, including humans. In this option, we explore the concept of attractiveness and aesthetic through a comprehensive approach that spans and intertwines biological, psychological, and cultural dimensions. We investigate what is deemed attractive and beautiful in the context of mate choice, examining the evolutionary and biological underpinnings of these preferences. Additionally, we delve into the realms of cognitive psychology and neuroaesthetics to understand how beauty is perceived and processed in the human brain. We also venture into the field of visual arts, exploring why certain artworks captivate us and are deemed aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, our exploration includes a discussion on appearance enhancement and unnatural attractiveness. We examine the psychological motivations behind such enhancements. Moreover, our exploration extends to understanding why some objects and designs are considered more appealing and desirable. This includes examining the principles of design and aesthetics that influence our perception of objects in our everyday environment. By covering these varied aspects, we aim to provide a holistic understanding of the multifaceted nature of beauty and attractiveness.",
