The British Psychological Society (BPS) accredits undergraduate psychology degree programmes in the UK. The BSc Psychology, BSc Psychology with x, and MPsych programmes have all been accredited by the BPS as conferring eligibility for the Graduate Basis for Chartered Membership (GBC) provided the minimum standard of qualification of second class honours is achieved. In order to achieve the minimum standard applicants are also required to have passed an honours level project in psychology (PSYC605). Obtaining GBC is the first step toward becoming a Chartered Psychologist.

Students on an accredited psychology programme are also eligible to become a student subscriber of the BPS. Student subscribers receive the monthly publication, The Psychologist. This publication has articles written by eminent psychologists which summarises their research or discusses a contemporary issue from a psychological perspective. It also has details about developments which affect the Society as well as containing details of jobs available to psychology graduates.
