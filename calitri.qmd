## Group-based rehabilitation interventions: A practical focus on their design and evaluation

This special option will focus on applied research into group-based rehabilitation. You will gain an insight into what it's like to be a social psychologist attempting to tackle some of societies significant health problems. There will be a practical focus on utilising current theory and evidence from social identity-based interventions for health and an exploration of best practice in the design and evaluation of them. You will gain exposure and practical insight into an array of design and evaluation frameworks that will become a valuable part of your toolkit for real world group-based intervention planning. Potential pitfalls and lessons learned from recent group-based rehabilitation interventions into stroke and obesity will provide insight into the collaborative and pragmatic nature of applied research.

Important note: The sessions on this option require active student participation, including group work and student-led summaries of discussions. You should only sign up for the option if you are willing to engage in this way. Full attendance at timetabled sessions is expected.

The following article provides an excellent and useful insight into how we can develop and manage effective group interventions for behaviour change (e.g., improving wellbeing, reducing loneliness, weight management) through the careful consideration of social identity processes.

### Assessment

Create an electronic poster using a PowerPoint slide (size A0). Choose one of the societal health problems listed below and design a novel, social-identity based intervention to address the problem. Using appropriate frameworks, illustrate the stages you would work through in the design of the intervention and outline your plans for evaluation. Identify at least three potential problems that might arise from intervention design and evaluation and how you would mitigate these.

Health Problems:

. Option 1: How to reduce loneliness in stroke survivors living remotely

. Option 2: How to improve the mental health of teenagers using nature

. Option 3: How to help people at risk of diabetes lose weight
