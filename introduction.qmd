In Stage 4 of your programme there are no mandatory taught modules - you are free to chart your own path across 32 different specialist psychology options. This offers you over 50,000 unique pathways so you can follow your aspirations and gain and specialist skills and knowledge for **your** future.

Our Stage 4 options are delivered in four modules, listed here. Students taking BSc Psychology or any MPsych course take all four modules, and students studying a combined honours degree (BSc Psychology with another subject) take the modules marked \* only.

#### Semester 1

PSYC601: Current Topics in Psychology 1\*

PSYC602: Current Topics in Psychology 2

#### Semester 2

PSYC603: Current Topics in Psychology 3\*

PSYC604: Current Topics in Psychology 4

### Module structure

Option modules contain a number of option topics that students choose from. This means that students can choose different options, even though they may be registered for the same modules.

Each module consists of two blocks of options, which run one after the other. Block A comes first, and contains options that are assessed by coursework. This is followed by Block B, which contains options that are assessed by exam. Students must choose one option from each of Block A and Block B for each module that they are registered on. This means that the total number of options chosen across Stage 4 will be:

BSc Psychology and MPsych: Eight options (two in each of four modules)

Combined honours: Four options (two in each of two modules)

Blocks run in sequence, so students attend one option at a time. Each block consists of three weeks of scheduled sessions. The sequence of blocks is shown in the following table.

| Weeks                    | Block     | Students       | Assessment |
