## Foundations of clinical psychology

Clinical psychology is about helping people who are experiencing mental health problems. But what happens when we begin to question the traditional disease model, and to look beyond conventional approaches to mental health? This option will give you good foundational knowledge of clinical psychology while bringing in some fresh perspectives.

**Lecture 1 -- Principles of clinical psychology**

In Lecture 1 we will create a solid foundation for the rest of the option by exploring key concepts in clinical psychology. What does it mean to be a reflective scientist-practitioner? What place do personal values have in professional practice?

**Lecture 2 -- Counselling theory and practical skills**

In Lecture 2 we look at counselling (non-directional psychotherapy) in detail. Where did this therapy come from, and what skills does a counsellor or non-directive psychotherapist need? You will be given a choice of different activities designed to help you understand and experience these clinical skills.

**Lecture 3 -- CBT theory, skills, and applications**

In Lecture 3 we look at Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) in detail. How did CBT come about, and what is it, exactly? You will have the opportunity to learn about and practice cognitive-behavioural techniques including CBT formulation, thought-challenging exercises, and behavioural experimentation. We will also explore how CBT can be used and applied beyond traditional therapeutic settings.

**Lecture 4 -- Critical psychology**

From here on, things become a little different. Using a guided problem-based approach, we will explore the concepts of critical psychology and critical theory. What does social justice have to do with clinical psychology? What happens when we look at clinical psychology and psychotherapy through this critical lens?

**Lecture 5 -- Spirituality and psychotherapy**

We are hearing more and more about the 'spiritual dimension' of our lives---about mind, body, and spirit---and even the idea of a biopsychosocialspiritual approach to healthcare. But what do we really mean when we talk about spirituality in this context? Is it essential to consider the spiritual for a truly holistic practice, or is this something we shouldn't even be discussing as scientist-practitioners? Lecture 5 explores recent shifts towards integrating spirituality into psychotherapy. What might this mean, not only for clinical psychology, but for our broader worldview?
