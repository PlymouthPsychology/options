## Clinical psychology with people with intellectual disabilities

Clinical psychology could be said to owe a debt to people with intellectual disabilities (also termed learning disabilities in the UK).  The use of psychometrics and behaviour therapy in long stay institutions formed some of the early work of psychologists within the health service and contributed to the development of the profession.  In the twenty first century, working as a clinical psychologist with people with intellectual disabilities has a greater focus on empowerment, equality and human rights.  It is a varied, fascinating and uplifting area of clinical practice.  This module will offer an overview of the role of clinical psychology within services for people with intellectual disabilities.  We will cover the history of terminology and classification and explore current definitions of the term ‘intellectual disabilities’, including associated genetic conditions, behavioural phenotypes and a social constructionist perspective.  We will examine the history of clinical interventions with people with intellectual disabilities and explore their development to contemporary clinical practice.  We will also explore the impact of the wider social context and of hearing the voices of people with intellectual disabilities.
