title: "Withdrawal"
---

Students who wish to withdraw from their programme should consult their personal tutor for advice. If this is not possible then the Senior Tutor or Programme Leader are available as backups.

Discussing issues that affect your studies may lead to a resolution without recourse to withdrawal. An alternative to withdrawal from the programme is the option to suspend studies for a period (e.g. one academic year). This is sometimes a good option for students who need to deal with things that may otherwise hinder their studies.

Students thinking of suspending should first talk to their personal tutor to understand the process. The tutor can liaise with the Faculty office to clarify the steps required.

Students should be aware that there are deadlines for the full or partial refund of tuition fees.
