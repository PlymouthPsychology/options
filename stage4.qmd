title: "Stage 4"
---

Single honours students take all five modules listed below. Combined honours students take modules marked \* as well as one 20-credit module per semester in their minor subject.

The four "Current Topics" modules contain a number of option topics, allowing you to choose what you want to study. These topics will be described at the start of each module, so you don't need to make any choices beforehand.

### Semester 1

PSYC601: Current Topics in Psychology 1\*

PSYC602: Current Topics in Psychology 2

### Semester 2

PSYC603: Current Topics in Psychology 3\*

PSYC604: Current Topics in Psychology 4

### Dissertation

PSYC605: Research Project\*

The dissertation module is unique in our programmes in two ways. Firstly, it is taken across both semesters. Secondly, it is worth 40 credits instead of 20. This means that your mark in this module has twice as much weighting in your final degree calculation as each of your other Stage 4 modules.
