## Psychology and the natural world

This option will explore aspects of Environmental Psychology. Broadly speaking, Environmental Psychology is an applied sub-discipline of psychology that examines the relationship between people and their physical environment. It focuses on how environmental conditions influence people as well as on how individuals perceive and act on the environment. This option will focus on the natural environment specifically, examining a) theories, b) empirical research and evidence, and c) practical application and real-life examples of how nature impacts us; and how, through our behaviour, we impact the natural world. This option will answer the following questions:

1.  What is Environmental Psychology?

2.  What are the benefits of spending time in nature to our mental health and wellbeing and cognitive performance?

3.  What is our emotional, cognitive and behavioural relationship with the natural world, and why is this important?

4.  What is "pro-environmental behaviour"? Why is it important, and why do some people behave pro-environmentally and others not?

5.  What drives our behaviour? How and when do social norms play a pivotal role?

### Format

This option will be taught in 5 interactive classes (2 hrs. each), which combine short lectures with interactive elements such as discussions, group activities, and self-reflections. Each lecture will be accompanied with suggested further reading (journal articles, watching videos, listening to podcasts) to do before and/or after the timetabled session.

### General reading

Further, specific readings will be recommended in each class
