## Craving and addiction

This option will explore the cognitive aspects of craving, and the role that it plays in addiction. We will look at the causes of cravings, and the role that they play in leading to use  of addictive substances, consumption of foods, or engagement in other activities. By understanding the nature of craving, and the cognitive processes that are involved in craving, we will try to work out why some people give in to cravings, and why some people can abstain. We will consider the implications that this has for treating addiction and appetitive disorders, and for motivating beneficial behaviours.

Format: This option will be taught with five seminars that combine lecturing and small group work during the session and in-between sessions.
