## Reducing prejudice

Please note, that this Option necessarily includes material that some may find upsetting, offensive, exclusionary, and harmful. You must consider the material within the Joining Instructions section of my DLE area before beginning this Option.

### Overview

Hate crime. Political partisanship. Terrorism. Climate change? Prejudice may be the defining issue of the twenty-first century, and is among the most pervasive and robust phenomena in psychology. In this option, we'll explore prejudice through the lenses of social constructionism and social cognition. We'll engage the psychological causes of prejudice by adopting an ecological systems perspective, considering how person-level prejudice may be driven by 'macro', situational, and individual factors. We will also consider the applied field of prejudice-reduction. Finally, we will identify some interesting future directions in prejudice research.
