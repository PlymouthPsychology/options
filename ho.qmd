## Feeling the world: From emotions to thoughts and behaviours

This option will explore views from different emotion theories to understand the nature of feelings: whether they are primarily emotional experiences or cognitive states of consciousness. We argue that feelings are not only direct translations of external stimulations, but also depend on interoception and high-level cognitive processing. Indeed, feeling is closely related to the concept of the self and consciousness, therefore, is likely to be reflected by our thought patterns that represent the information processed by human cognition.  

By exploring the interplay of emotion, thought and behaviour, we examine how ongoing thought patterns can be utilized for examining emotional experiences and how this method can be adopted for clinical diagnosis of psychopathologies.

This option will have five 2-hours interactive classes consisting of lectures and small class activities for group discussions and/or self-reflections. Students are encouraged to do some readings and preparations beforehand.
