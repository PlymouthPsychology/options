## Transdiagnostic processes in mental health problems

This module will cover at least five types of psychological and behavioural processes that can be involved in mental health problems. It will include emotional processing, negative beliefs about the self and other people, perfectionism, avoidance and overthinking (rumination and worry). These factors can affect all of us at some points in our life, either directly or through the effects of them in people close to us. However, we vary in the nature in which we experience them, as a result of our genetic predispositions, life experiences and so on. Specific forms or overuse of these processes can contribute to our vulnerability to experiencing mental health challenges, or the extent to which these challenges continue, rather than naturally recovering with time.

Theory and research evidence for each of these processes will be covered in the lectures. You will be expected to discuss these processes in pairs within each lecture. You may also find it helpful to keep a self-reflective journal about your learning, and reflections about your own experiences of these processes and undertaking the module. There will be some time allocated to journal entries within each lecture.


### Lecture format

This will be taught in five lectures plus a revision lecture. Recommended readings will be given in each lecture.
