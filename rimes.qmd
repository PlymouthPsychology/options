## Transdiagnostic processes in mental health problems

This module will cover five types of psychological and behavioural processes. The lecture topics will address emotional processing, negative beliefs about the self and other people, perfectionism, avoidance and overthinking (rumination and worry). These factors can affect all of us at some points in our life, either directly or through the effects of them in people close to us. However, we vary in the nature in which we experience them, as a result of our genetic predispositions, life experiences and so on. Particular forms or overuse of these processes can contribute to our vulnerability to experiencing mental health challenges, or the extent to which these challenges continue rather than naturally recovering with time.

Theory and research evidence for each of these processes will be covered in the lectures. You will also be expected to discuss these processes in pairs within each lecture. The module will be assessed by a piece of self-reflective work about what you have learnt about these factors in relation to the theory, research evidence and your reflections about your own experiences of these processes and undertaking the module. Therefore you will be strongly encouraged to keep a self-reflective journal throughout the module. There will be some time allocated to journal entries within each lecture.

### Lecture format

This will be taught in five lectures plus a revision lecture. Recommended readings will be given in each lecture.
