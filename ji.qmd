## Harnessing the human imagination

People differ in their capacity to visualise, from those who can create vivid and detailed images in their mind, to those who cannot see anything at all (also known as "aphantasia"). Often referred to as "seeing" through the "mind's eye", "hearing" through the "mind's ear", and so on, the capacity to generate mental imagery is thought to help humans survive by remembering the past and anticipating the future. With modern research methods, psychological scientists are beginning to understand the nature and functions of our imagination, although much remains unknown. By the end of this module, you will have gained insight into questions like a) What does the imagination have to do with our feelings, motivations, and behaviours; b) How do distortions in the imagination contribute to mental health conditions; & c) Can we harness the imagination to motivates us to regulate our emotional wellbeing and make healthier choices?
