## Memory and false memory 

This option will examine how theories of memory and false memory can help us understand memory phenomena in the real world. We will focus specifically on two topics: 1) recovered memories of trauma and sexual abuse in adults; and 2) allegations of false memory in child witnesses to sexual abuse. Using a variety of case studies as starting points for our discussion, we will consider the ethics and the controversies surrounding the application of laboratory-derived theories of false memory to memories of abuse and trauma in adults and children.

Format: Lectures mixed with some in-class discussion. Staying current with readings is essential. Exam topics will involve applying knowledge gained from lectures and readings to a novel case study.
